# Enigma Machine Emulator

This is an [in-browser Enigma machine emulator](https://enigma-machine-emulator.web.app/) built in Rust with the Yew framework and compiled into WebAssembly (WASM). This implementation includes the 5 rotors used by the Enigma I variant and the Enigma M3 Army variant.

## Readme from an Earlier Command Line Version of this Emulator

This is an Enigma machine emulator built in Rust that can be run from the command line. This implementation includes the 5 rotors used by the Enigma I variant and the Enigma M3 Army variant.

## Default Configuration

If no configuration settings are provided, this implementation defaults to using the following configuration:

| Setting Type    | Setting Value                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Right Rotor     | III (implemented as 3)           |
| Middle Rotor    | II (implemented as 2)            |
| Left Rotor      | I (implemented as 1)             |
| Rotor Positions | AAA (implemented as 000)         |
| Ring Settings   | AAA (implemented as 000)         |
| Reflector       | B                                |
| Plugboard       | No Default Plugboard Connections |

## How to Use

The following command line arguments can be used to alter the configuration of the emulated Enigma machine:

| Short | Long             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| -r    | --reflector      | reflector (Valid reflector types are 'B' and 'C') [default: B]                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -b    | --plugboard      | plugboard (string of chars that will be used to create a hashmap in which each even indexed alphabetic char is mapped to the next odd indexed alphabetic char. Example 'AB CD' will swap 'A' <=> 'B' and swap 'C' <=> 'D' [default: none] |
| -h    | --help           | Print help                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Examples

`enigma.exe -o test` encodes the text as `ZFDU` using the default configuration.

`enigma.exe -o test -t 543 -p 1,2,3 -s 4,5,6 -r c -b "AB CD EF GH"` encodes the text as `HFJL` with the settings being left rotor (III, rotor position 3 = 'D', ring setting 6 = 'G'), middle rotor (IV, rotor position 2 = 'C', ring setting 5 = 'F'), right rotor (V, rotor position 1 = 'B', ring setting 4 = 'E'), reflector 'C', and plugboard mapping of 'AB CD EF GH'

See the unit tests in main.rs for additional examples of encrypting and decrypting different inputs.
